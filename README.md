# Neural-Style-Transfer
# ðŸŽ¨ Neural Style Transfer with PyTorch

This project demonstrates **Neural Style Transfer**, where the artistic style of one image (e.g., a famous painting) is transferred onto the content of another image using a pre-trained VGG19 convolutional neural network.

## ðŸ“Œ Task Description
**Task-05:**  
Apply the artistic style of one image to the content of another image using neural style transfer techniques.

## ðŸ’¡ What is Neural Style Transfer?

Neural Style Transfer (NST) uses deep learning to combine the **content of one image** with the **style of another image**. This is done by minimizing content and style loss functions using features extracted from a pre-trained VGG19 model.

## ðŸ§  Features

- Use of **VGG19** pretrained network
- Transfer learning using **PyTorch**
- Clean, minimal code with explanations
- Compatible with CPU and GPU
